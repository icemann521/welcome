          I'm currently employed as a full-time Automated Broadcast Director at (Insert TV Station). I've been working
          in television news for
          16 exciting years. I'm looking to take my creativity and passion for television news production and transition
          into a new career, a new career of Front End Development.

        <p>I first started my new adventure into HTML and CSS in the start of 2021. I haven't been working on this full
          time, but I've been slowly learning and expanding my skills. I've been using FreeCodeCamp, Youtube, & Udemy as
          my sources for learning and education. The Definitive Guide: Visual Presentation for the Web and
          HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites, are the two books I research with to help aid with my learning of
          the principles of Front End Development.

        <p>For the past 16 years, I've worked on most aspects of television news production. I started my career right
          out of college in 2006 in Ft. Myers Florida as a production assistant and within 2 years, I worked my way up
          to graphics operation, technical directing and directing.
          <br><br>
          I worked for another 2 more years before moving to Houston TX as a full time Television Director. I've spent
          the past 12
          years honing my craft and working in all sorts of stressful environments due to breaking news and breaking
          weather
          coverage.
